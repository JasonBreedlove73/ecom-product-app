Project overview:

This project was to build an e-commerce product listing app using react.
The project was to reinforce React components, props, and state by designing a layout without using frameworks.

The project taught me about component hierarchy(parent,child), how to use state to hold an array of products, how to pass props to a component, and how to iterate over products using .map().

The task was to display product details like name, price and description (bonus if we added a category).
I used props to recieve data and render it dynamically.

I used CSS to syle the page to make it more visually appealing and give it that polished look.
This project was a lot of run and im looking forward to learning more with React!
